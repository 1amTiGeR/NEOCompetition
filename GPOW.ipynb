    "\n",
    "By leverage the power of distributed ledger, the conventional secured connection techniques such as HTTPS/SSL can be drastically simplified. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have $N_A$ and $N_B$ with the public key and private key to be ($PU_A$,$PV_A$) and ($PU_B$, $PV_B$) respectively,  the below steps are only required to be excuted only once for all. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $N_A$ generate a symmetric key $K_S$ (a.k.a. **Sustainable Symmetric Key** or **SSK** ). \n",
    "2. $N_A$ uses $PU_B$ and asymmetric encoding algorithm $E$, metadata $\\lambda$ and signiture function $Sig$ to generate the message $M = Sig(E(PU_B, \\lambda),PV_A)$ , then boardcasts $M$ to blockchain. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, $N_A$ and  $N_B$ can directly use $K_S$ to encrypt/decrypt the traffic without asymmetric handshake, no matter onchain or offchain.\n",

    "1. has a set $\\Upsilon$ with $n$ types of predefined or later registered tasks: $\\Upsilon$ = {$T_n$}, $n \\ge 1$. For any $i \\in [1, n]$,  we have $T_i \\equiv$  {$G_i, E_i, O_i, V_i $}, where $G_i, E_i, O_i$ and $V_i$ (a.k.a **GEOV functions**) are functions with particular characters discussed in *Session 1.2*,\n",

    "A typical life cycle of task instance $\\tau \\in T_i$ is described below:\n",
    "1. At beginning, node $N_A$ tries to initiate $\\tau$ by excuting $G_i$(a.k.a. **Task Generation Function**),  $(\\vec{p},\\vec{q})=G_i(\\vec{r})$, where $\\vec{r}$ as $N_A$'s input.\n",
    "2. $N_A$ calls $P$ to pick up $m$ random nodes $N_{v_1},… N_{v_m}$.  Then generate message by following algorithm:\n",
