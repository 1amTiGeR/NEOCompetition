    "### 1.1 Sustainable Symmetric Key\n",
    "\n",
    "By leverage the power of distributed ledger, the conventional secured connection techniques such as HTTPS/SSL can be drastically simplified. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have $N_A$ and $N_B$ with the public key and private key to be ($PU_A$,$PV_A$) and ($PU_B$, $PV_B$) respectively,  the below steps are only required to be excuted only once for all. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $N_A$ generate a symmetric key $K_S$ (a.k.a. **Sustainable Symmetric Key** or **SSK** ). \n",
    "2. $N_A$ uses asymmetric algorithm $E$,  $PU_B$, metadata $\\lambda$ and signiture function $Sig$ to generate the message $M = Sig(E(PU_B, \\lambda),PV_A)$ , then boardcasts $M$ to blockchain. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, $N_A$ and  $N_B$ can use $K_S$ to secure the traffic for unlimited times, without asymmetric handshake, no matter the traffic is onchain or offchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reset SSK due to key leakage or version upgrade, $N_A$ can simple repeat the above steps. $N_B$ always take the latest one.\n",

    "## 2. Service: Definition, Negotiation, Evaluation and Compensation \n",
    "\n",
    "Any service, no matter the consumer and provider parties comes from human community or computer network, can be incontestably processed only when four predefined interactive components achieved accurate consensus. These components are Definition, Negotiation, Evaluation and Compensation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Consumer abstracts and refines the requirement from its raw demond,  and \n",
    "\n",
    "1. avoid any functional or qualitative dispution caused by indistinction or obscuration.\n",
    "2. expose enough and just enough information to support the provider's service, in order to maximize privacy protection and minimize the cost of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negotiation**: Consumer and the network should be isolated from the complexibility of the service. Since\n",
    "\n",
    "1. these roles are not required to be professional,\n",
    "2. providers keep their tactic and resource private unless it's listed in *Definition*. In this way, providers can maintain their competitiveness and are couraged to innovate to increase the profit space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In free market scheme, Consumers negotiate the price by comparing the bidding from all providers who claim capable to handle the *Definition*. \n",

    "A distributed consensus network is **DNEC compatiable**, if\n",
    "\n",
    "1. every node  $k$ in this network has an asynmmetric key pair ($PU_k, PV_k$), where $PU_k$ is the public key (address) and $PV_k$ is the private key used for signiture. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. There's a universial currency to measure the value of service. There's a way to calculate its balance of each account. Denote the balance as $B_k$ for node $k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. this network has $n$ types of predefined or later registered services {$S_n$}, $n \\ge 1$. For any $i \\in [1, n]$, define $S_i \\equiv$  {$D_{S_i}, N_{S_i}, E_{S_i}, C_{S_i} $}, where $D_{S_i}, N_{S_i}, E_{S_i}$ and $C_{S_i} $ are the Definition, Negotiation, Validation and Compensation functions developed to support the particular type of service $S_i$. We also call $Si$ a **DNEC Service**.\n",

    "### 1.2 DNEC Service life cycle\n",
    "A typical life cycle of service instance $s \\in S_i$ in a *DNEC network* is described below:\n",
    "1. The service provider node $p$ boardcasts an offer message announcing it's capacity $Cap^{p}_{Si}$ for running service $Si$, along with its unit compensation $Rate^{p}_{Si}$ respectively. The message is $M_{offer}(PU_{p},\\{Cap^{p}_{Sn}\\},\\{Rate^{p}_{Sn}\\} | PV_p) $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consumer node $c$ creates the service instance $s$ by excuting $D_i$(a.k.a. **Definition Function**). $\\vec{d_s}=D_{S_i}(PU_c, \\vec{r_s})$, which takes $c$'s input $\\vec{r_s}$ to encrypt sensitive data, standalize the data format, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $c$ then calculate $(Vol_s, PU_p) = N_{S_i}(\\vec{d_s}) $, where $Vol_s$ is the common estimation of the volume of $s$, and $PU_p$ is the recommended provider's address. In most cases, $N_{S_i}$(a.k.a. **Negotiation Function**) create a list $L_{P}^{S_i}$ with the addresses of all the providers of $S_i$ by filtering the nodes with $Cap_{Si} \\gt 0$, then iterate every provider $p_j$ with following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. Filter out $p_j$ if it's available capacity is less than $Vol_s$. Concretely, say $p_j$ is already working on $l_j$ instances of $S_i$ with the volumes of $\\{Vol_{l_j}\\}$,  filter it out if  $ Cap^{p_j}_{Si} - \\Sigma Vol_{k} \\lt Vols $ \n",

    "5. $N_A$ compares the nodes offering service \n",
    "\n",
