### 1. Definition

In following discussion, we assume *Node* running on a distributed consensus network, no matter what consensus algorithm the network actually implemented upon.

The network, since genesis, has a list of the types of predefined **GPoW Tasks**.  Every instance *t* of any GPoW Task *T* is a mathmatic problem, which

1. The initiator of *t* can be any node in the network, normal node or malicious node. For some Ts, input parameter vector $\vec{r}$ is mandatory or optional.
