## 1. Challenges of IoT and related projects

{TODO: To finish this section, can mainly cite the following two aricles coming from IEEE IoT}

	1. [IoT+BlockChain: Benefits and Challenges](https://iot.ieee.org/newsletter/january-2017/iot-and-blockchain-convergence-benefits-and-challenges.html)
	2. [IoT Trends 2018](https://iot.ieee.org/newsletter/january-2018/iot-trends-in-2018-ai-blockchain-and-the-edge.html?highlight=WyJibG9ja2NoYWluIl0=)

### 1.1 Node capability

Most IoT nodes have limited storage and calculation power. The consensus algorithms
employed in BC (POW or POS) require significant computational resources which are far beyond the capabilities of most IoT devices. {TODO. NOTE: Can also cite some ideas from these two articles in other sessions.} [LINK1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.02969.pdf), [LINK2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05187.pdf)

Ethereum's light client protocol is still under development [LINK](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Light-client-protocol). 

### 1.2 DDoS attack

IoT has already turned into a serious security concern that hackers can produce DDoS attacks.  {TODO}  [LINK1 ](https://www.iotforall.com/5-worst-iot-hacking-vulnerabilities/) 

Blockchain technology leveraging randomlized peers brings the potiential of DDoS-resistant. {TODO} [LINK](https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/25/how-blockchain-based-apps-and-sites-resist-ddos-attacks/)  ( *Paragram: Attacking the miners directly is close to impossible. They do their work behind a peer-to-peer network designed to resist any sort of direct attack called the Bitcoin protocol. Peer-to-peer networks are notoriously hard to stop or even disrupt. Attacking the transactions is also close to impossible because they are stored in everyone’s copy of the blockchain and cryptographically verified by the mining process.*) 



### 1.3 Connection stability

{TODO} [LINK](https://iot.ieee.org/newsletter/january-2017/iot-and-blockchain-convergence-benefits-and-challenges.html)



### 1.4 Compatibility

{TODO} [LINK](https://iot.ieee.org/newsletter/march-2017/three-major-challenges-facing-iot.html) (Refer to **Standard** session:*Technology standards which include network protocols, communication protocols, and data-aggregation standards, are the sum of all activities of handling, processing and storing the data collected from the sensors* ) 

Blockchain tech provides a chance to make message level standardization. {TODO}



### 1.5 Recent IoT distributed ledger projects  

Some IoT projects are experimenting other decentralized topology. The most famous one is IOTA. However, its light nodes rely on [manual assigning public nodes as servers](https://www.iotasupport.com/lightwallet.shtml), which recently practially failed to resist DDoS attacks {TODO} [LINK](https://freedman.club/en/cryptocurrency-iota-ddos-attack-revealed-the-problem-of-network-scalability/) There are also other concerns of IOTA that we can see from [HERE](https://hackernoon.com/why-i-find-iota-deeply-alarming-934f1908194b)

ITC doesn't have much process on their project {TODO} [LINK](https://steemit.com/blockchain/@smcaterpillar/iot-chain-china-s-new-iota-an-easy-investment-or-should-we-set-off-the-alarm-bells-let-s-do-our-homework). It's based on Ethereum, which means low speed and you need to pay gas for every conversation, which is not applicable for most IoT scenarios. 

Steemr, providing beautiful user interface, is targeted to provide a market for offchain stream data. It's also based on Ethereum. Their network is so far running totally offchain with nothing about the their ERC20 token. {TODO: The last Q/A} [LINK](https://blog.streamr.com/2018/02/faq-streamr-ethereum-network/)



## 2 NEOT: The 1st Practical IoT Blockchain Solution



### 2.1 Key components

![struBasic](pics/components.png "Picture 3-1 NEOT Network Basic Node Structure")

Key components in NEOT's network includes following:

#### Sensor 

*Sensor* is the ultimate information capturer of the really world and the terminal of existing IoT networks. A typical *sensor*:

1. has unidirectional **Data** output, with the form of pulsing, streaming, etc. The encoding of *data* may or may not conform to international standards. 
2. has an instruction set for remote configuration and controlling. Some also implement the status query functionalities and the feedback/acknowledge machanism. We define this set as bidirectional **Signals**. 
3. is not designed to handle heavy computational work or persist huge volume of data, in order to reduce the manufacture cost and battery consumption.
4. in many scenarios, is exposed in unstable communication environment. 
5. in many scenarios, pairs with, or as an element of a *sensor* cluster connects with a **Sensor Delegate**. The *delegate*, which can be a specialized hardware, or an API mounted in a common device, also provides *data* and *signal* interfaces. In the NEOT's point of view, *sensor delegate* is equivalent to *sensor* as they both provide bidirectional signal and unidirectional data interfaces. Therefore we see these delegates as "sensors" to simplify the description.

One NEOT node is capable to attach multiple *sensors*. A node attached with at least one *sensor*  is call a NEOT **Sensor Node (SN)** .

*Sensor nodes* act as the service provider in *Private Data* user cases, while the consumer in *Public Data* user cases. Check session 2.5 for the details of these user cases. 

#### Nest

*Nest* is a device equiped with significant computational power (a.k.a. **Computation Nest**) or huge storage capacity (a.k.a. **Storage Nest**), or simply providing human-computer interface (a.k.a **HCI Nest**). *Nest* interact with the rest of NEOT node with very similar way as the *sensors* in *Sensor Nodes* except that the data flow can be bidirectional. *Nest* Nodes acts as the service provider in *Private Data* user cases, while the consumer in *Public Data* user cases. Check session 2.5 for the details of these user cases. 

One NEOT node can attach multiple *nests*. There could be **Nest Delegates** but we see them as *nests* with the same reason on *sensor delegates*.  A node with at least one *nest* attached is called a NEOT **Nest Node**. In the rest of this article, we also call *sensor* and *nest* the **Terminals**. 

#### Tunneo

*Tunneo* (a.k.a TN) is a PDNE compatible layer open to serivce developers. 

NEOT developer team will participate partially by providing some toolset SDK used for standalized *data* and *signal* I/O portal and encapsulate common on-chain and off-chain tasks. 

NEOT developer team will upgrade the SDK regularly to fix the defects and enhance it's functionality.

For more information about what PDNE protocol can do, please refer to {TODO}

#### Adapter

*Adapter* is a customizable component connecting *terminals* and *Tunneo*. *Adapter* implements **NEOT Interfaces**, and provides standardized *data* and *signal* with NEOT node via *Tunneo*.

*NEOT Protocol* is open to 3rd party, such as terminal manufacturers and indie developers. Everyone who wants to connect their IoT devices to NEOT to leverage the power of blockchain and PDNE service is free to join in, no permission required. We call these developers as **Adapter Developers**.

Once released, *NEOT Protocol* will be kept fixed except serious issue founded, providing *adapter developers* the best flexibility and reduce their cost of forced updates or re-deployment.

The structure of NEOT 

#### Motivate all parties

![valueflow](pics/roles.png "Picture 3-1 NEOT Network Basic Node Structure")



Leveraging the power of PDNE standard, there are mainly four parties in NEOT's network: Providers, Consumers, Adapter Developers, PDNE Developers. Each parties would be motivated to improve the ecosystem. The above figure demonstrates the flow of the value following the arrow's direction:

*Consumers* pays fees for the PDNE services provided by NEOT Node. *PDNE Developers* write 



Manufacturers and indie developers who want to connect their IoT devices to NEOT can implement the 



Although it's a great aspiration that we put all the *signal* or even *data* generated throughout the network into blockchain, we must admit that it's impratical today due to the reasons discussed in session 1.5, even many chain consensus algorthims partcially sacrifice the character of decentralization to enhance the speed and to reduce the ledger size. The problem is especially serious for IoT applications because of the node capacity limitations.

Nevertheless, we agree that the blockchain performance and IoT node capacity will continue improve in the further. So why not migrate the business onto the chain gradually?

With this approarch, the work of inital versions of *tunneo* will tend to support the less frequent and small sized user cases. Such as transaction and scoring.

### 3.2 Smart City Use case

According the research, More than 67% of the global population will be lived in the city at 2035. with growing population, the public resouce utlization will be more and more challenge for city’s administrative and organization

This bring the solution of smart cities, a concept that refers to using digit information (open data) in city administration and services to improve aspects such as efficiency, security, the environment, citizen participation, the economy and others.

The detail of implementation will leverage the Internet and the Internet of Things (IoT) and make city into a hyper-connected society, both among people and machines. after data is collected, other technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and big data will play a heavy role to use those data in various way for smart city implementation

 
Here is several ideal use case which use blockchain technology with smart city implementation:

#### 3.2.1 Administrative Area:

Registration and Documentation: for public services in city, governments are responsible for governance, the economy, social issues, mobility, security, culture and the environment. These activities consist of a huge number of different processes that require a high frequency of registration and documentation, and their transparency and security are essential.

Blockchain offers a technology to establish this process, as one of its main characteristics is a neutral, non-hierarchical, accessible and secure information database in environments where there is currently no confidence among the actors. This makes it ideal for avoiding corruption and creating transparency in dealings with the government.
 

Unified citizen service:  Many government records (laws, expenses, income, contracts, permits, properties, etc.) also correspond to other areas of service. With a blockchain record, they are naturally interconnected, reinforcing the value of cross-cutting coordination of the services. 

Those blockchain implementation will be a huge save of mantainance cost for the KYC based services, such as banks, insurance company etc. who need to check individual's related history. They just need to temporary ask users to provide the prove of the ownership of the account and retrieve information from blockchain.

#### 3.2.2 Integrated Blockchain Platform:

In addition to the purely administrative areas, blockchain can also be very relevant to urban planning and the management of public resource, sustainable transportation, public safety, the environment, the circular economy, smart buildings, etc.

Although each service (economy, transportation, environment ...) can be modernized, the major revolution that smart cities provide over the innovation of each individual service is the horizontal integration of all of them into a single, cross-cutting system. the blockchain could be a very appropriate alternative for information exchange in smart cities with its a secure, transparent, decentralized native feature.

 
the blockchain platform can be an open, sustainable ecosystem around public, private and implementation-driven software platform standards that will ease the development of new Smart Applications in multiple sectors.

it will provide the benefit of the government management, the urban planning,  the collaborative economy and sustainability policies, in the framework of smart cities

#### 3.2.3 Smart Traffic System

With Internet of Vehicles, all the vehicles are connected into internet, same as traffic light.Each car had an electronic car plate which uniquely identify the car with plate information, sticker information, car information, driver information and so on.
Those information is captured and integrated into blockchain and can be used for the following scenarios:
 
##### a.	ownership/sticker management  
##### b.	traffic ticketing/accident management 
##### c.	car plat fraud detecting
##### d.	parking management
##### e.	criminal prevention
##### f. 	...

With blockchain platform support, other organization such as insurance company can eaily get the full driving record from driver. Meanwhile, since the relationship between the blockchain node and real world car is confidential, it will be transparent that individuals' privacy is ensured. 

The data of blockchain are public and easily ingested into big data platform (digit platform). big data experts can use these historic pattern of data to feed into traffic light system to improve the traffic performance. also with data analysis, it will provide the support for decision making such as city planning, budget allocation, construction planning, road servicing and so on.
